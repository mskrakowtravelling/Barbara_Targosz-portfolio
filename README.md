My portfolio was created as the final project of SheCodes Responsive course. At the beginning it was a personal page and I have since changed it into the portfolio showcasing my projects. 
The page is fully responsive
I used bootstrap to add various features 

Future changes:
- changing content of the "Personal" section
- changing logo 
- adding more detail to "About Me" section
- Changing "Contact Me" section
- add form to Cocora Valley section
